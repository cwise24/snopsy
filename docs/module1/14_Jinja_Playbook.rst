Jinja Playbook
===============

What is Jinja2?

*"Jinja2 is a modern day templating language for Python developers. It was made after Djangoâ€™s template. 
It is used to create HTML, XML or other markup formats that are returned to the user via an HTTP request."*[#]_

| Using ``set_fact`` to build a new variable ``interface`` and using Jinja filters for only the interfaces

     - hosts: [switches]
       gather_facts: false
      
       tasks:

       - name: Gather vlan info
         ios_command:
           commands: show vlan
         register: vland


       - set_fact:
           interface: "{{ vland.stdout_lines[0][2].split(\" \") | select('match', '^(Fa|Gi)') | list }}"


       - debug:
           var: interface

Now that we have captured only index 2 of our inner list, we can further split the string up by white spaces and only keeping those strings starting with *Fa* or *Gi* and storing those items into our new list *interface*
