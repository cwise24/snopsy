Module 2

GitOps
++++++

*GitOps* is the practice of managing infrastructure and configurations using Git. Git becomes the single source of truth; meaning it contains the entire state of systems and provides 
a complete audit trail of changes.

This modules focus is only on Git.  Building upon the few tasks completed in Module 1, We will now focus on more of the daily uses, building branches and working from outside the *main* branch
and merging updates in.
