      NAME
        git -  the stupid content tracker

"is a distributed version-control system for tracking changes in source code during software development. 
It is designed for coordinating work among programmers, but it can be used to track changes in any set of files. 
Its goals include speed, data integrity, and support for distributed, non-linear workflows."  [#f1]_

| **TL;DR** 
| A nice way to manage chaos across distributed teams
